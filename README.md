# Genetic Algorithm for Job Shop Scheduling

## 1. Project Overview
This project implements a scheduling system using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize job shop scheduling in a manufacturing environment. The system determines the optimal sequence and timing for each job, aiming to minimize production time and maximize throughput.

## 2. How Genetic Algorithm Works?
A genetic algorithm is an AI-based optimization technique inspired by natural selection. It consists of:
- **Population:** A set of potential solutions.
- **Chromosomes:** Individual solutions in the population.
- **Genes:** Elements within a chromosome representing specific aspects of the solution.
- **Fitness Function:** Evaluates the effectiveness of each solution.
- **Genetic Operators:** Improve offspring quality using selection, crossover, and mutation.
- **Selection Process:** Chooses individuals for reproduction based on their fitness.

## 3. Algorithm Workflow

1. **Initialization:** Generate an initial population of schedules.
2. **Fitness Assignment:** Evaluate the fitness of each schedule.
3. **Selection:** Choose the best schedules for reproduction.
4. **Reproduction:** Apply crossover and mutation to generate new schedules.
5. **Termination:** Repeat the process until a termination condition is met.

## 4. Problem Formulation
- **Chromosome Representation:** Each chromosome is a list of job sequences, where each job consists of multiple operations.
- **Crossover:** Exchanges subsequences between parent chromosomes to produce better offspring.
- **Mutation:** Introduces diversity by swapping operations within a chromosome.
- **Objective Function:** Evaluates the efficiency of a generated schedule and aims to minimize total completion time.
